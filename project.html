    <h1>PROJECTS</h1><br>
    <h2><b>MINI PROJECT</b></h2><br>
 
      <p>1] Vehicle Movement Based Street Light</p><br>
 
      <pre>
       The  project  aims  at  saving  energy  by  detecting  the  vehicle  movement  on  highways  and  switching 
       on  the  block  of  street  light  ahead  of  it  and  simultaneously  switching  off  the  trailing  lights. 
       The  project  requires  sensors  to detect  the  vehicle  movements  and  switches  on  the  lights  ahead 
       of  it.  As  soon  as  the  vehicle  moves  ahead  the  trailing  lights  automatically  switches  off. 
       This  can  be  used  to  save  a  lot  of  energy  instead  of  using  conventional  system  where  the  street 
       lights  are  remained  ON.  Another  mode  of  operation  can  be  used  where  the  lights  are  remained 
       ON  with  10%  intensity  and  when  the  vehicle  passes  by  the  lights  ahead  of  it  are  switched  on 
       with  100%  intensity  and  the  trailing  lights  revert  back  to  10%  intensity.  PWM  is  used  for 
       intensity  control  through  microcontroller.  The  sensors  sense  the  vehicle  movements  and  send  it  to 
       a  8051  microcontroller  that  initiates  commands  for  switching  the  lights  ON/OFF

      <h2><b>MAJOR PROJECT</b></h2><br>
 
       <p>1] Smaetwheel Chair</p><br>
 
       <pre  style="text-justify: auto;">
 
         In  INDIA  there  are  thousands  of  people,  who  are  facing  disability.  They  face  many  problems 
         on  regular  basis  and  they  feel  unwanted  and  rejected  from  the  society.  Wheelchair  usage  in 
         INDIA  is  growing  sharply  due  to  population  ageing,  increased  number  of  road  accidents  cases 
         and  injuries  during  locomotion.  After  some  age  people  may  depend  on  their  family  members  to 
         avoid  this  we  are  implementing  smart  wheelchair.
 
 
         Our  mindset  has  to  change  and  accept  these  people  into  our  society.  For  this  reason,  we  are 
         building  a  smart  wheelchair  which  would  be  helpful  to  these  people  for  being  self-dependent. As 
         we  know  that  the  needs  of  many  people  with  disabilities  can  be  overcome  with  power  wheelchair, 
         but  some  portion  of  this  community  is  finding  it  difficult  to  operate  power  wheelchair. Through  
         we  have  evolved  in  the  field  of  health  care  and  technology,  but  we  are  still  not  good  enough
         to  solve  difficulties  of  this  sector  of  population. The  smart  wheelchair  is  related  to  arduino 
         controlled  along  with  alternative  use  of  manual  joystick. 
 
 
         The  main  objective  of  smart  wheelchair  is  to  felicitate  and  increase  the  movement  of  people  who 
         are  handicapped  and  the  ones  who  are  not  able  to  move  freely. Therefore,  we  are  coming  up  with 
         a  design  of  wheelchair  which  will  be  an  asset  for  medical  department  and  to  make  it  more 
         advanced  in  existing  technology  to  allows  the  people  to  live  a  free  life. 
 
 
         In  a  simple  language  a  smart  wheelchair  is  a  machine  with  wheels  enabling  easy  movement, 
         which  empower  a  physically  disabled  person  to  move  around  with  less  dependency  on  others. 
         People  have  disabilities  with  their  hands,  foots,  lower  extremities  which  puts  a  limit  to  perform 
         regular  task  in  their  daily  life.  Still  these  wheelchairs  have  not  satisfied  the  needs  of  the  
         disabled  people.  It  is  therefore  crucial  that  problems  are  understood  in  detailed  accordingly  and  
         depending  on  the  requirement  sensors  should  be  equipped.
 
         Shopping  centers  with  large  sales  floors  are  increasing.  It  is  very  difficult  for  the  elderly  and 
         people  with  disabilities  so  this  smart  wheelchair  may  help  them.  A  significant  number  of 
         disabled  or  elderly  people  require  a  smart  wheelchair.  It  is  a  multipurpose  device  which  can  be 
         used  for  day-to-day  life.  It  should  be  operated  always  in  the  safe  mode  and  durable  for  long 
         period  and  cost  effective.
         
         
         The  main  agenda  of  this  project  is  to  enable  a  disabled  person  to  move  with  less  difficult.  
         Due  to  exponential  growth  of  technology  with  time,  it  is  needed  to  provide  easily  operated  machines.
         The  various  modes  of  control  will  allow  to  move  the  chair  with  less  human  intervention.
         Smart  wheelchair  can  be  used  to  enhance  the  quality  of  life  for  many  people.  The  job  of  the 
         smart  wheelchair  is  to  take  input  from  the  user  and  work  accordingly,  usually  in  the  form  of  a 
         small  joystick.
